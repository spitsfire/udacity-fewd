				<p class="description">One of the most toxic of all vertebrate animals, porcupine fish are popular in Japanese media and cuisine. Only specially trained chefs are allowed to serve porcupine fish. Those who die from the toxin are usually regular fishermen who try their hand at cooking the lethal fish by themselves.</p>
