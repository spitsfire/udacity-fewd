You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

> My top priority is focusing on each lesson's coding syntax in order to keep my coding consistent and in line with "best practices". I think an early foundation of proper syntax will help me more easily write and read code in the future. The more I progress in this degree, the more difficult the syntax will become, but my code will always remain coherent and orderly if I start working to ensure best practices even with the most simplest of elements now.   

> I have also been learning to slow down and read everything the courses give me. Sometimes the urge to speed through a specific lesson because I "know" the content rears its head. But I am reminding myself that not all resources and information about a specific subject are the same. Sometimes you learn new things that other sources have left out. I keep this in mind so that I don't miss anything that might have supported me in the future.

> I have previous experience in web design and basic html coding, so a lot of the basics have been simple review for me. As a child I spent a lot of time making layouts and fansites in my spare time. Some of that experience has stuck with me, which has allowed me to consume beginning lessons quickly.

> So far, my biggest obstacle is simple syntax errors, like misspells. They are hard to catch because your brain sometimes fills in those little missing characters for you. For example, I had to spend a lot of time on the Figures quiz because of one word that I had accidentally clipped off the caption content.

> As previously mentioned, the Figures quiz was difficult for me to pass through the Feedback extension correctly. I double and triple checked my tags and found no errors. Because of this, I wondered if it was really a problem on my end or the extension, so I turned to the Udacity community for answers. I found several students who were also struggling with "The figcaption attribut[ing] the photographer." One student's suggestion finally led me to realize I had clipped a word off the beginning of the caption content. Once it was fixed, the code passed. By using the resources avilable to me, like community support, I was able to finish the quiz. Phew!
